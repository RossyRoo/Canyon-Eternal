# Canyon-Eternal

Welcome to the Canyon Eternal Github Repo! Take a look through ‘Project Structure’ to get familiar with how the Unity file is organized. It’s really important for the game to stay organized at this early stage, so please be cautious with what you move and where you put new assets so that everyone on the team can find them.

Project Structure

Animations - Contains the animators and animations for all characters, environments, etc.

Art - Contains all sprites for characters, items, UI, and tiles.

Controls - This contains data for the Player Controls Map.

Data - Contains scriptable objects such as SFX Banks, Melee weapons and spells, and other data.

Imports - Contains all imported assets

Prefabs - This contains all original, non-imported prefabs

Scenes - This is where different levels will be organized by their location in the world map. For example, the folder “Lord’s Gate” will contain all scenes that take place in the first area of the Canyon, whereas the folder “Hometown” will contain all scenes prior to arriving at the Canyon.

Scripts - This is where programmers will keep their scripts. These are organized by functionality.

Tile Palettes - This is NOT where tile sprites are located, but rather where we will save the data for tile palettes and the tile sets generated by Unity after we drag the sprites into the tile palette editor window. Tile sprites themselves will be kept in the Art folder.
